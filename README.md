An admin should be capable of performing all operations performed by Librarian or Student, and admin account cannot be deleted.
Admins should be able to:

* View the borrowing history of each book.
* Delete Student/Book/Librarian from the system


## Librarian

A librarian should have at least the following attributes: 
* Email (unique for each account)
* Name 
* Password
* Library

Anyone can sign up as a librarian using their email, name and password. After signing up, they must be approved by an admin before they can perform the following tasks:

* Log in with email and password.
* Edit their own profile to choose an existing library. Each librarian can only work for one library.
* Edit library attributes.
* Add/Remove books to/from a library.
* View & Edit book information.
* View all books.
* View hold requests for any book in the library he/she works in.
* For books in the special collection, accept or deny book hold request.
* View list of all the books that are checked out from their library.
* View the borrowing history of the books from their library.
* View the list of students with overdue books from their library along with overdue fine.


## Students

A student should have at least the following attributes: 
* Email (unique for each account), 
* Name 
* Password
* University
* Maximum number of books (**N**) that can be borrowed at any given time.

Anyone can sign up as a student using their email, name and password. After signing up, they can perform the following tasks:

* View the list of all the libraries
* View all books
* Check out/Request/Return a book from any library.
* Renew/Modify/Delete a reservation.
* View/Edit their account attributes (including changing their password).
* Search through the books
  * Search by title
  * Search by author
  * Search by publication date
  * Search by category
* Bookmark a book they are interested in.
* View their bookmarked books.
* At any given time, a student can borrow a max of '**N**' number of books.
* View the overdue fines for his/her account. 
* Receive an email when any of their book request is sucessful.

### Book Hold Request
* If the book is available, proceed to check out:
  * If the book is in Special Cllection list, add this to Librarian's approval list and wait. 
  * Otherwise, add the book to student's checked out list
* If the book is unavailable or the student has checked out **N** books already,
  * Inform the student that the book is unavailable or max limit reached.
  * Create a book hold request if the student wants to continue requesting.  
  
* Number of hold requests for a book should be visible to every user

### Returning a book
* If there is no hold request for a book, return and increase the available count of the book
* If there is a pending hold request,
  * Approve the hold request and add the book to the checked out list of the requested student
  * Send a mail to the student that the book is checked out.

## Notes
* There will be only one admin in the system, and this account will be preconfigured. 
* A librarian can add more than one book.  
* Each student can bookmark/request multiple books. They can also remove themselves from the bookmark/request list for a book.
* It’s up to you whether a user should be able to sign up as both an librarian and a student with the same email address or not.  Either way is OK.

## Miscellaneous

### Testing

* Thoroughly test one model and one controller (prefer RSpec testing framework).

### Deployment
**_Please ensure that your deployment is always accessible for grading_**. You can deploy your app to any of the following: (Try to perform continuous deployment)

* Heroku or any similar PaaS (OpenShift, etc.) with free plans
* Amazon AWS
* NCSU VCL

### Bonus (Extra Credit)
You can do any or all of the below tasks for extra credit (each item below is worth **5 points**).
* No student/librarian should access any private content associated with other student/librarian/admin's account.
* All users can use their LinkedIn/Google/Facebook account (implementing any one of them is enough) to log into the system.

## Submission
Your submission in Expertiza should consist of the following-

* A link to your deployed application
* A link to your repository
   * Credentials for the preconfigured admin and any other information that reviewers would find useful should be in the README.md file in this repository
